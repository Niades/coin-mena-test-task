# TL;DR

I ask you to give me more time to complete this task. I literally had no free time to do that, but I
have it now. I had my mental health problems, I had to see a doctor, I had to buy meds. I have a lawsuit
on my hands which I needed to collect my documents for. On the weekend I had a complete mental breakdown:
I was in a super depressed state unable to do anything buy cry all day long. That is why I went to the doctor.
These are all valid reasons.
Again, I ask for more time to complete this task.

# Description

Unfortunately, I did not have enough free time to complete the task fully, "Trade page" is non-existent.
However, I would like to highlight some of the parts of this code to maybe allow me to get more time to
complete it fully. I think one of the things worth mentioning is the Technical Stack.

## Technical Stack

I used `HeadlessUI` and `tailwind-css`. I love utility-first CSS approach and have a lot
of experience using both of these technologies.
I used `zustand`. This is another great match because my last project (I worked on it for 2
years in a product company) used `zustand`, so 2 years of expertise with it.
You can also see that I used `react-query`, but I did not have time to do more with it.


Another thing that I would like to mention is my `git` approach.

## Git Approach

I am very careful with my approach to `git` history and try to maintain it the best way possible.
Please check out my [commits history in this repository](https://github.com/Niades/coin-mena-test-task/commits/main)
where you can see a live example of how I work with `git`.
