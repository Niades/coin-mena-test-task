# Description

Unfortunately, I did not have enough free time to complete the task fully, "Trade page" is non-existent.
However, I would like to highlight some of the parts of this code to maybe allow me to get more time to
complete it fully. I think one of the things worth mentioning is the Technical Stack.

## Technical Stack

I used `HeadlessUI` and `tailwind-css`. I love utility-first CSS approach and have a lot
of experience using both of these technologies.
I used `zustand`. This is another great match because my last project (I worked on it for 2
years in a product company) used `zustand`, so 2 years of expertise with it.

Another thing that I would like to mention is my `git` approach.

## Git Approach
I am very careful with my approach to `git` history and try to maintain it the best way possible.
Please check out my [commits history in this repository](https://github.com/Niades/coin-mena-test-task/commits/main)
where you can see a live example of how I work with `git`.
